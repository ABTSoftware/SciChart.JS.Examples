# [/Documentation Folder](Documentation)

All documentation is hosted online at [scichart.com/javascript-chart-documentation](https://scichart.com/javascript-chart-documentation).

The docs have recently been updated to include embedded codepen.io snippets and both JavaScript and Builder-API code samples.

The [/Documentation Folder](Documentation) folder contains supporting code and project files for us to deploy accurate, working documentation code samples. We recommend viewing the documentation online at [scichart.com/javascript-chart-documentation](https://scichart.com/javascript-chart-documentation).

However, you can browse into [/Documentation](Documentation) and start the project if you want to browse 100s of mini code samples that are hosted throughout the docs.
