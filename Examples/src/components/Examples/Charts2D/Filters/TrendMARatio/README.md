# Trend MA Ratio Example

## Overview

This example demonstrates dynamic data transforms using SciChart.js. It creates a chart that displays an original random walk series and applies several filters including moving averages, a linear trendline, a scale offset, and finally a ratio filter. Implementations for Angular, React, and Vanilla JavaScript are provided.

## Technologies Used

-   SciChart.js Library
-   Angular (using the scichart-angular component)
-   React (using the SciChartReact component)
-   Vanilla JavaScript & TypeScript
-   RandomWalkGenerator and SciChart Filters API for dynamic transforms

## Code Explanation

-   **drawExample (drawExample.js / drawExample.ts):** This function initializes a SciChartSurface with a theme and sets up axes. It creates an original data series from a random walk and applies dynamic transforms: two moving average filters (lengths 10 and 20), a scale offset filter, a linear trend filter, and a ratio filter (comparing the original to the offset series). An annotation is added to explain that SciChart.js supports dynamic transforms. Chart modifiers for zooming and panning are also added.
-   **Angular (angular.ts):** Defines an Angular standalone component that uses the scichart-angular component. The component passes the drawExample callback to initialize the chart.
-   **React (index.tsx):** Provides a React functional component that uses the SciChartReact component to call drawExample and render the chart.
-   **Vanilla (vanilla.js and vanilla.ts):** Both files show how to invoke the drawExample function in a plain JavaScript/TypeScript environment and obtain a destructor function for clean-up.
-   **Supporting Files:** The example also includes an image file (javascript-trend-ma-ratio.jpg) and imports from shared resources (such as theme definitions and data generators) that are part of the SciChart.JS examples repository.

## Customization

-   **Chart Styles:** Stroke colors, thickness, and dash arrays are defined using the imported theme (appTheme) and are applied to each renderable series.
-   **Axis and Visible Range:** The ratio axis has a visible range of (-20, 20), which can be adjusted based on the desired display.
-   **Filter Parameters:** The moving average filters have configurable lengths (10 and 20). The scale offset filterâ€™s offset and scale are also set and can be modified as needed to experiment with different transformations.

## Running the Example

To run any example from the SciChart.JS.Examples repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the entire repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ABTSoftware/SciChart.JS.Examples.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Examples Directory**: Change into the `Examples` folder:

    ```bash
    cd SciChart.JS.Examples/Examples
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary packages using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the Development Server**: Start the development server to view and interact with the examples:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will launch the demo application, allowing you to explore various examples, including the one in question.
