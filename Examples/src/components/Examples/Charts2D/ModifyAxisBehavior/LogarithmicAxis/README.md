# Logarithmic Axis Example

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to create a SciChart.js chart with logarithmic scaling on both the X and Y axes. The chart displays multiple exponential curves and allows interactive switching between logarithmic and linear axes. Implementations are provided for Angular, React, and Vanilla JavaScript (with both JavaScript and TypeScript examples).

## Technologies Used

-   SciChart.js: High performance charting library for JavaScript
-   Angular (standalone component using scichart-angular)
-   React (using TypeScript with SciChartReact and Material UI components)
-   Vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript: Direct use of the SciChart API

## Code Explanation

-   **Angular Implementation (angular.ts):** This file defines an Angular standalone component that uses the `<scichart-angular>` custom element. It assigns the `drawExample` function to initialize the chart on the root element.

-   **Chart Drawing Code (drawExample.js / drawExample.ts):** These files contain the main logic for setting up the SciChartSurface. They configure two pairs of axes: one pair of logarithmic axes on the X and Y directions and one pair of hidden linear axes. The logarithmic axes use a log base of 10 and a scientific label format. Three fast line renderable series are added to the chart, each using exponential data series generated by an ExampleDataProvider. Additionally, interactivity is added via a range of modifiers such as RubberBandXyZoomModifier, MouseWheelZoomModifier, ZoomExtentsModifier, and LegendModifier. These files also customize the chart title styling and grid line brushes.

-   **React Implementation (index.tsx):** The React component renders a SciChart surface using the SciChartReact component. It also provides a toggle button group (using Material UI components) that allows the user to switch the visibility of the logarithmic and linear axes. When toggled, a handler function updates which pair of axes is active by setting the appropriate `isVisible` and `isPrimaryAxis` properties and reassigning the axis IDs on the renderable series.

-   **Supporting Assets:** An image file is included (javascript-chart-logarithmic-axis.jpg) which likely serves as a visual preview or thumbnail for the example.

## Customization

Key configuration options in this example include:

-   **Axis Settings:** The logarithmic axes are configured with a log base of 10, scientific numeric format, label precision of 2, and 10 minor ticks per major tick.
-   **Series Configuration:** Three fast line series are created with different exponential curves (e.g., y = x^2, y = x^2.2, y = x^2.4) and use a SweepAnimation with an 800ms duration.
-   **Chart Styling:** The chart uses a custom theme (appTheme) that sets properties such as grid line brushes, title styling (including font size, weight, color, and padding), and point marker styling.
-   **Interactivity Modifiers:** The chart includes zooming (mouse wheel and rubber band), zoom extents, and legend modifiers to enhance user interaction. In the React version, toggle buttons allow dynamic switching between logarithmic and linear axis representations.

## Running the Example

To run any example from the SciChart.JS.Examples repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the entire repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ABTSoftware/SciChart.JS.Examples.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Examples Directory**: Change into the `Examples` folder:

    ```bash
    cd SciChart.JS.Examples/Examples
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary packages using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the Development Server**: Start the development server to view and interact with the examples:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will launch the demo application, allowing you to explore various examples, including the one in question.
