The implementation features dynamic data loading and aspect ratio preservation.\n\n## Technical Implementation\nThe chart uses `ETriangleSeriesDrawMode.List` mode to render geographic polygons as triangle meshes, with a color palette for differentiation. A custom `preserveAspectRatio` function maintains correct proportions during resizing. The example includes interactive modifiers like [ZoomExtentsModifier](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/typedoc/classes/zoomextentsmodifier.html) and implements efficient data management through `setConvertedData` and `clearMap` methods.\n\n## Features and Capabilities\nKey features include dynamic map rendering with color-coded regions, outline visualization, and real-time aspect ratio correction. The solution demonstrates handling complex geographic data structures while maintaining performance through WebGL rendering.\n\n## Integration and Best Practices\nThe implementation showcases proper SciChart surface lifecycle management and efficient data series handling. Developers can extend this for real-time geographic data visualization applications.",

The component leverages React's lifecycle for efficient chart management.\n\n## Technical Implementation\nThe implementation uses the [SciChartReact](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/typedoc/classes/scichartreact.html) component with an `initChart` function that creates both [FastTriangleRenderableSeries](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/typedoc/classes/fasttrianglerenderableseries.html) (for filled regions) and [FastLineRenderableSeries](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/typedoc/classes/fastlinerenderableseries.html) (for outlines). The `preserveAspectRatio` function ensures proper scaling, while modifiers like [MouseWheelZoomModifier](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/typedoc/classes/mousewheelzoommodifier.html) enable interaction.\n\n## Features and Capabilities\nThe example features dynamic data loading through `setConvertedData`, color-coded regions using a predefined palette, and automatic aspect ratio maintenance. The solution demonstrates React-specific patterns for managing complex chart state and updates.\n\n## Integration and Best Practices\nThe implementation follows React best practices by encapsulating chart logic and exposing clean API methods (`setMap`, `clearMap`). Developers can integrate this with geographic data pipelines while benefiting from SciChart's WebGL performance.",
