It visualizes geographic data with [FastTriangleRenderableSeries](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/typedoc/classes/fasttrianglerenderableseries.html) for terrain coloring and [FastLineRenderableSeries](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/typedoc/classes/fastlinerenderableseries.html) for state outlines.\n\n## Technical Implementation\nThe implementation uses triangulation to convert geographic coordinates into renderable triangles with [ETriangleSeriesDrawMode.List](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/typedoc/enums/etriangleseriesdrawmode.html) mode. Data is loaded from predefined arrays and styled based on population density metrics. The chart includes interactive modifiers like [ZoomPanModifier](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/typedoc/classes/zoompanmodifier.html) for navigation.\n\n## Features and Capabilities\nThe example shows dynamic recoloring of states based on selected metrics (population, area, or density) using a custom interpolation function. City markers are displayed using [FastBubbleRenderableSeries](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/typedoc/classes/fastbubblerenderableseries.html) with data labels.\n\n## Integration and Best Practices\nThe implementation follows JavaScript best practices with async chart initialization and proper surface disposal. The aspect ratio preservation logic ensures correct map proportions during resizing.",

It demonstrates geographic data visualization with React hooks integration.\n\n## Technical Implementation\nThe chart uses [FastTriangleRenderableSeries](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/typedoc/classes/fasttrianglerenderableseries.html) in List draw mode to render state polygons. The React component passes the `drawExample` function to SciChartReact for initialization. State management for metric selection is handled externally.\n\n## Features and Capabilities\nThe implementation features dynamic data binding for metric visualization and preserves aspect ratio during resizing. City markers with interactive labels are implemented using [EllipsePointMarker](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/typedoc/classes/ellipsepointmarker.html).\n\n## Integration and Best Practices\nThe example demonstrates proper React integration by separating chart logic from presentation. The async initialization pattern follows SciChart's [React integration guidelines](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/TutorialReusableReactComponent.html).",

The implementation uses [NumericAxis](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/typedoc/classes/numericaxis.html) for coordinate mapping and [XyDataSeries](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/typedoc/classes/xydataseries.html) for geographic data.\n\n## Features and Capabilities\nThe component supports dynamic metric switching with preserved aspect ratio. It combines triangle series for filled states, line series for borders, and bubble series for city markers, demonstrating [SciChart's multi-series capabilities](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/Chart%20Types.html).\n\n## Integration and Best Practices\nThe example follows Angular best practices using standalone components and proper chart disposal.
