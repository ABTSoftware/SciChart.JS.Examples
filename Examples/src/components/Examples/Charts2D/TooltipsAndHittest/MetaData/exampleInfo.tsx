                    "## MetaData Labels, Tooltips and Rendering Example - JavaScript\n\n### Overview\nThis example, demonstrates how to create an interactive line chart using SciChart.js with JavaScript. It visualizes a dataset where each Xy data point is augmented with `metadata` that drives customizations such as point colors, dynamic labels, and interactive tooltips.\n\n### Technical Implementation\nThe chart is set up by asynchronously initializing a `SciChartSurface` with configured X and Y axes using the `NumericAxis` class and a defined `growBy` range via `NumberRange`. An `XyDataSeries` is created by mapping the provided X and Y values and attaching a `metadata` object (a custom JavaScript object) for each Xy data point. Customizations are applied through a custom `PaletteProvider` that adjusts the color of each point marker based on `metadata`. This is achieved using the helper function `parseColorToUIntArgb` for color conversion. Additionally, a custom `DataLabelProvider` extracts labels from metadata with a `metaDataSelector`, following concepts from [Getting Labels from Metadata](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/DataLabelsFromMetadata.html). A `RolloverModifier` is employed to provide interactive tooltips, enabling dynamic adjustments of marker and tooltip colors based on the underlying data. Text annotations are added using the `TextAnnotation` class, which supports relative coordinate modes for flexible placement.\n\n### Features and Capabilities\nThis example showcases **metadata-driven customization** where additional properties within each data point dictate not only the visual styling (such as point marker color via a custom palette provider) but also the data labels and tooltips. Such an approach allows each data point to be individually styled and can support features like highlighting or selection. Developers seeking to further understand the concepts can read about the [DataSeries Metadata API](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/DataSeries%20PointMetaData%20Api.html) here.\n\n### Integration and Best Practices\nThe implementation follows best practices for asynchronous initialization and resource cleanup in JavaScript, as shown by returning a destructor function that disposes of the `SciChartSurface` when no longer needed. This pattern is recommended in the [Getting Started with SciChart JS](https://www.scichart.com/getting-started/scichart-javascript/) guide. Although a React wrapper is provided in the project, the core implementation uses plain JavaScript, making it highly adaptable to various environments. By leveraging these techniques, developers can build highly interactive charts with a focus on performance and maintainability.",

The chart renders a spline line chart where each Xy data point holds additional `metadata` (a custom JavaScript object). This metadata is used to drive custom point styling, data labels, and interactive tooltips.\n\n### Technical Implementation\nThe chart is initialized asynchronously using the `SciChartSurface.create()` function and is embedded within a React component using the `<SciChartReact/>` wrapper, as described in the [React Charts with SciChart.js](https://www.scichart.com/blog/react-charts-with-scichart-js/) guide. A data series is constructed by mapping an array of objects with extra `metadata` to the `XyDataSeries`. Custom styling is implemented by overriding point marker colors through a custom `PaletteProvider` that implements the `IPointMarkerPaletteProvider` interface. Additionally, dynamic data labels are provided via the `LineSeriesDataLabelProvider`, enabling labels to be sourced directly from the metadata (see [DataLabels from Metadata documentation](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/DataLabelsFromMetadata.html)). Additionally, the example shows how chart modifiers such as the `RolloverModifier` can be utilized to enhance user interaction by providing real-time metadata-driven tooltips.\n\n### Features and Capabilities\nKey features of this example include: \n- Custom point coloring and highlighting based on metadata values\n- Dynamic labeling where data labels are automatically derived from each point's metadata\n- Advanced tooltips that display additional metadata such as custom labels and selection status\n- The use of `SplineLineRenderableSeries` with custom point markers for enhanced visual style\nThe performance is optimized by leveraging asynchronous chart initialization and WebAssembly for high-performance rendering.\n\n### Integration and Best Practices\nThe example illustrates best practices for integrating SciChart.js in React. By utilizing the `<SciChartReact/>` component, developers can ensure that the chart integrates smoothly with Reactâ€™s component lifecycle. For further insight into efficient React integration and performance optimization techniques, refer to the [React Charts with SciChart.js](https://www.scichart.com/blog/react-charts-with-scichart-js/) article and the [Performance Optimisation of JavaScript Applications & Charts](https://www.scichart.com/blog/performance-optimisation-of-javascript-applications-charts/) resource.\n",

Each data point carries custom `metadata` that drives dynamic point coloring, advanced tooltips, and data labels. The example leverages asynchronous chart initialization along with WebAssembly rendering for optimal performance.\n\n### Technical Implementation\nThe chart is created asynchronously using SciChart.js's API where numeric axes, a spline line series, and annotations are programmatically configured. A data series is constructed by mapping raw X and Y values along with `metadata` - custom JavaScript objects containing properties which can drive label text, custom data-point color, and selection state. This metadata is then utilized in multiple ways: a custom `PaletteProvider` dynamically adjusts point marker colors based on `metadata`, a custom `DataLabelProvider` extracts labels directly from metadata for each point, and a `RolloverModifier` displays interactive tooltips that include `metadata` details. For additional details on implementing metadata-driven tooltips and data labels, refer to the [Metadata and Tooltips documentation](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/DataSeries_PointMetadata_Tooltips.html). The asynchronous initialization approach and Angular integration using `ScichartAngularComponent` is further detailed in the [Getting Started with SciChart JS](https://www.scichart.com/getting-started/scichart-javascript/) guide.\n\n### Features and Capabilities\nThe example includes real-time interactive updating of point appearance based on metadata, custom point coloring using a `PaletteProvider`, and dynamic labeling via a `DataLabelProvider`. Interactive tooltips display extra information such as custom labels and selection status, enhancing user interaction. The implementation leverages WebAssembly for high performance rendering, ensuring that even with these advanced features the chart remains responsive. Developers can explore the customization options provided by the [PaletteProvider API](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/The%20PaletteProvider%20API.html) and further refine label behavior as described in [Getting Labels from Metadata](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/DataLabelsFromMetadata.html).\n\n### Integration and Best Practices\nIn Angular applications, managing the chart lifecycle is crucial. The example demonstrates efficient integration by initializing the chart asynchronously and ensuring proper disposal to prevent memory leaks. Performance enhancements are achieved through the use of WebAssembly and optimized rendering techniques outlined in the [Performance Optimisation of JavaScript Applications & Charts](https://www.scichart.com/blog/performance-optimisation-of-javascript-applications-charts/) guide. This approach emphasizes best practices for integrating complex, high performance charts in Angular environments while offering extensive customization through metadata.\n",
