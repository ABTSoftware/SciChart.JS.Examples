# Chart Title Example

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to configure, customize, and update the chart title in a SciChart.js chart using a React implementation. It shows how to create a multiline title, adjust title styling (such as alignment, position, and padding), and dynamically change title properties via user controls embedded in a toolbar.

## Technologies Used

-   **React** (with TypeScript – TSX)
-   **SciChart.js** for high-performance charting
-   **@mui/material** for UI components
-   **tss-react/mui** for styling

## Code Explanation

The main file, `index.tsx`, defines an asynchronous function `drawExample` which sets up the SciChartSurface. Within this function:

-   The chart title is initialized with a multiline string (`"Multiline\nChart Title"`) and configured with various style options, including font size, color, padding, and text alignment options (normal and multiline).
-   Two numeric axes (X and Y) are created, with custom axis titles and styles.
-   A fast line series is added to the chart using random walk data generated by the `RandomWalkGenerator`.
-   Several control update functions are defined (e.g., `updateTitleText`, `updateTitlePosition`, etc.) to allow dynamic updating of the title’s properties.

The React component `FeatureChartTitle` uses React hooks to maintain state and handle changes via form controls (textarea, select dropdowns, and checkbox). These controls are linked to the update functions from `drawExample`, allowing the chart title and its style to be modified interactively. Additionally, an image (`javascript-chart-title.jpg`) is provided as part of the example, likely serving as a screenshot reference.

## Customization

Key configuration options in this example include:

-   **Title Text**: Change the chart title text using a textarea input; supports multiline text using newline characters (`\n`).
-   **Title Position & Alignment**: Use select dropdowns to modify the title position (e.g., top) and the horizontal alignment of both the overall title and its multiline content.
-   **Placement Within the Chart**: Toggle whether the title is placed within the chart area using a checkbox.

These settings are adjusted by updating the `sciChartSurface.title` and `sciChartSurface.titleStyle` properties dynamically through the provided control functions.

## Running the Example

To run any example from the SciChart.JS.Examples repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the entire repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ABTSoftware/SciChart.JS.Examples.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Examples Directory**: Change into the `Examples` folder:

    ```bash
    cd SciChart.JS.Examples/Examples
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary packages using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the Development Server**: Start the development server to view and interact with the examples:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will launch the demo application, allowing you to explore various examples, including the one in question.
