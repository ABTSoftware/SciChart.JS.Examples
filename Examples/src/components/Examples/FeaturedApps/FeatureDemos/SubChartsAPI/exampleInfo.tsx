                    "# SubChartsAPI in React\n\n## Overview\nThis example demonstrates how to integrate SciChart.js within a React application to create complex sub-chart compositions. The implementation focuses on using functional components along with React hooks such as useEffect, providing a streamlined approach to building high-performance charts with advanced features in a React environment.\n\n## Technical Implementation\nThe implementation leverages the Builder API with JSON data to configure and instantiate chart surfaces. It utilizes Reactâ€™s useEffect hook to initialize and manage SciChartSurface instances, ensuring optimal resource management and performance. Essential to this approach is the use of React refs for managing the lifecycle of the chart instances, an approach detailed in [Creating a SciChart React Component from the Ground Up](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/TutorialReusableReactComponent.html). Additionally, the application minimizes unnecessary re-renders, in line with techniques discussed in [ReactJS Sweep Line: Optimizing SciChartJS Performance](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77781766/reactjs-sweep-line-optimizing-scichartjs-performance-reusing-wasmcontext-for-m).\n\n## Features and Capabilities\nThe SubChartsAPI example provides several powerful features:\n\n- **Real-time updates**: Optimized React state management is used to handle high-frequency data updates successfully. Further insight into this implementation can be found in [Adding Realtime Updates](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/Tutorial%2004%20-%20Adding%20Realtime%20Updates.html).\n\n- **Sub-chart composition**: Multiple sub-charts are composed within a single SciChart.js component. This modular approach allows for clear separation of chart functionalities and is similar to the patterns shown in [React Chart Examples | SciChart.js](https://demo.scichart.com/react).\n\n- **Advanced interactive features**: The example implements interactive annotations and custom behaviors using advanced SciChart APIs. Developers can explore these capabilities further as described in [The Annotations API Overview](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/The%20Annotations%20API%20Overview.html).\n\n## Integration and Best Practices\nThe example adheres to best practices for React integration by utilizing functional components and React hooks to initialize, update, and dispose of chart instances effectively. Efficient ref management is used to prevent memory leaks, as emphasized in [Memory Best Practices](https://www.scichart.com/documentation/js/current/MemoryBestPractices.html).\n\nAdditionally, the solution takes advantage of performance optimization techniques to reduce unnecessary re-renders, which is crucial in dynamic data environments. Developers are encouraged to also review [What is React Strict Mode and why is my application double re-rendering?](https://www.scichart.com/blog/what-is-react-strict-mode-and-why-is-my-application-double-re-rendering/) for insights into further optimizations.\n\nOverall, the SubChartsAPI example in React serves as an excellent resource for developers looking to combine the power of SciChart.js with modern React development practices for building robust, interactive, and high-performance visualizations.",
