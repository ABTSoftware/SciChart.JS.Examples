## [Documentation Snippets](DocumentationSnippets)

The folder [Documentation Snippets](DocumentationSnippets) contains code used in the [SciChart.js documentation](https://scichart.com/javascript-chart-documentation). 

We publish here on Github so the code is versioned, testable and then included into the documentation.

If there's a specific code sample from the docs that you want to re-use, you can probably find it here.
