# SciChart.js Example - Hit-Testing Points Demo

This example showcases how to use the Hit-Test API in SciChart.js.

On click ```lineSeries.hitTestProvider.hitTest``` is called and this returns a ```HitTestInfo``` object. 

Querying the properties lets you determine if the user clicked over a point or not. 

The nearest point is plotted and is coloured red or green depending on hit or miss.
