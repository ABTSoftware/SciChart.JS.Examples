# SciChart.js Angular Demo

## Step 1: Adding SciChart to your Angular Application

If you haven't already done so, add SciChart.js to your Angular application.
Additionally, we recommend using the official [Angular wrapper for SciChart](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scichart-angular)

```Angular
npm install scichart scichart-angular
```

## Step 2: Wasm file deployment

Loading the required WASM dependencies:

SciChart.js requires additional WASM modules to function properly: scichart2d.wasm and scichart2d.data for instantiating SciChartSurface, and scichart3d.wasm and scichart3d.data for SciChart3DSurface.

SciChartSurface.configure({
wasmUrl: "/scichart2d.wasm",
dataUrl: "/scichart2d.data"
});

SciChart3DSurface.configure({
wasmUrl: "/scichart3d.wasm",
dataUrl: "/scichart3d.data"
});

## Step 3: Creating the chart

Sure! Hereâ€™s a revised version of your README.md with grammar corrections and slight improvements for clarity:

bash
Copy code
npm install scichart scichart-angular
Step 2: WASM File Deployment

typescript
Copy code
SciChartSurface.configure({
    wasmUrl: "/scichart2d.wasm",
    dataUrl: "/scichart2d.data"
});

SciChart3DSurface.configure({
    wasmUrl: "/scichart3d.wasm",
    dataUrl: "/scichart3d.data"
});

## Step 3: Creating the Chart
Add the drawExampleAnimation3D function in app.component.ts.

Then, include the SciChart Angular selector in app.component.html:
    <scichart-angular [initChart]="drawExampleAnimation3D"></scichart-angular>

    
# Running the example

```
npm install
npm start
```
